  <p>Randonautica is a mobile app that uses a quantum random number generator to give you a set of coordinates for your local area. The idea is to encourage you to explore your area with an idea in mind of what you&rsquo;d like to come across. It could be something simple as seeing something worth taking a photo of, or something more complex like an answer to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/randonauts/comments/gj2zcx/first_randonaut_adventure_we_set_our_intention_as/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">question you&rsquo;ve been pondering.</a></p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve ventured out, you&rsquo;re encouraged to share what you&rsquo;ve found online. Some people post on forums, whereas others choose Reddit. Either way, it&rsquo;s a way of fostering a community, and loads of people have shared uncanny coincidences.</p>

  """
  <p>You can use Randonautica by downloading the app from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/randonautica/id1493743521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.randonautica.app&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play store</a>. Once that&rsquo;s done, load it up, and you&rsquo;ll be required to enable GPS and provide the radius you&rsquo;d be willing to explore within. You&rsquo;ll can then select if you would like to visit water spots.</p>
<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll be asked if you&rsquo;d like to visit an attractor, void, or anomaly. An attractor is a spot the app deems has the highest concentration of quantum dots, whereas a void is the least. An anomaly is the strongest pick of those two different options.</p>
<p>At this point, think about what you&rsquo;d like to get out of your trip. Typically, this is advised to follow a certain theme. If you have an artistic block, for example, you could go with creativity.</p>
<p>Finally, hit ANU, so Randonautica gives you a location to go and explore.</p>

  """
  <p>A Randonautica attractor is an area where quantum-points are highly concentrated. What that means is that the Randonautica app would deem such an area highly significant.</p>

  <p>Randonautica might not be working as the game is still in beta on iOS and Android, which means the developer is still working out the kinks. An influx of new users has also done little to help this. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/randonauts/comments/gjwt9n/our_server_is_struggling_to_keep_up_with_200000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>&nbsp;post from May, the Randonautica developer explained that the servers might not be stable in moments where a lot of people are using the app.</p>
<p>If you find that Randonuatica is not working, we suggest the usual fixes: restart the app, switch your phone on and off, or reinstall the app. If none of these work, you may just have to sit tight until Randonautica issues a fix for, er, Randonautica.</p>

  <p>A Randonautica void is the opposite of a Randonautica attractor, which means that it&rsquo;s an area where quantum-points are sparse. This isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, however. If a location is particularly void of quantum points, it has a better chance of being relevant towards your intention, seemingly.</p>
  """,
  """
  <p>A Randonautica anomaly is a name given to describe either a void or an attractor. Fully known as an &lsquo;Intention Driven Anomaly&rsquo;, it refers to a found pattern in quantum number dates. In layman&rsquo;s terms, it&rsquo;s an area that&rsquo;s believed to have been influenced by human thought.</p>

  <p>Randonautica ANU refers to the Australian National University which plays host to the quantum random number generator that provides Randonautica with the data it uses.</p>

  <p>A Randonaut is someone who uses a random number generator to pick a destination to explore. It&rsquo;s not an exclusive term, and you don&rsquo;t need to be an expert in the field to be one. Simply using the Randonautica app to go out and explore is enough, we reckon.</p>

  <p>Randonautica is as safe as any other application that asks for your GPS data, but there are some common-sense tips to keep in mind:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Keep your adventuring to the day time:</strong>&nbsp;the idea of going somewhere new may be exciting, but try and keep it to the daytime. It&rsquo;s safer and stops you from potentially getting lost in the dark</li>
<li><strong>Go with a group of friends if you&rsquo;re not confident:</strong>&nbsp;Randonautica doesn&rsquo;t have to be a solo adventure. If you typically go out with friends, you should do so here, too</li>
<li><strong>If it looks dangerous, it probably is:</strong>&nbsp;if you have to go through somewhere that looks dangerous to get to your destination, don&rsquo;t risk it. Your safety is more important than your curiosity</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t trespass:</strong>&nbsp;using Randonatica isn&rsquo;t an excuse to trespass to get to your destination &ndash; don&rsquo;t do it</li>
<li><strong>Keep lockdown and social distancing in mind:</strong>&nbsp;lockdown and social distancing advice is swiftly changing, but always keep it mind when you&rsquo;re going out to make sure you&rsquo;re not endangering yourself or anyone else</li>
</ul><p>And there you have it, that&rsquo;s what Randonautica is in a nutshell. If you&rsquo;re curious about more of the top games and apps right now, then we have a <a href="https://www.pockettactics.com/samurai-flash/guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samurai Flash guide</a>, too.
