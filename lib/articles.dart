<p>Dealing with the English side of Google Play is an easy process. You browse or search, download, and then install. Update your games/apps when you have to. Bam, you're done.</p>
<p>It's easy enough to grab games off Google Play from your region...but what about from others? Getting games from countries like Korea, Japan, and China is often a conundrum for foreigners due to region locking the downloads themselves on Google Play.</p>
<p>The usual advice to those wanting to play Asian Android titles is to download the APKs from third-party websites. This does work, but it can be either risky (there are a lot of risky APK download sites) or too much of a pain to bother in the long run once big updates come around and you need a new APK download.</p>
<p>One alternative that has proven to not only be reliable and trustworthy, but also easy to use, is Chinese app <a href="https://apps.qoo-app.com/en/">QooApp</a>. QooApp keeps track of popular Asian-region Android releases and updates their APKs the day of updates.</p>
<p>QooApp functions much like the Play Store in action. You can browse based on language and genre, then download directly from the app without dealing with region restrictions. User ratings are generally reliable and screenshots are abound, but don't expect English game descriptions. Most are in Chinese.</p>

<h2>Getting QooApp</h2><p>The one issue with getting your hands on this baby is it is not hosted on the Google Play store. Instead you have to manually go to the<a href="https://apps.qoo-app.com/en/app/880"> QooApp website and download it</a> onto your Android device.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that if your phone or tablet browser has trouble with websites opening separate tabs to download is that the actual QooApp download will not start.</p>
<p>If the above happens to you (like it did to me) you can instead download the APK onto your computer, upload it to a service like Mega or Mediafire, and then manually type the download URL into your phone's browser to get the download. Here's <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/v8w7152b2fdy806/QooApp-174.apk">my own QooApp upload</a> that I manually downloaded, uploaded, and downloaded again for my own use. Please note this download or the install may not work at a later date.</p>
<p>I jumped on the QooApp bandwagon to get access to the many Japanese RPGs on Android these days. Anyone itching to do the same would do well to grab this valuable tool and get ready to eat their bandwidth with game downloads. Thanks, China.</p>

<h3>Notification Centre...</h3>
Reply -Notifications related to your replies you've posted around the app. Like -Notifications of likes to your posts around the app.
Notifcation -"Junk mail" You can delete these with "Clear all" at the top-right 3 dot icon
<h3>My Comics...</h3>
When you ❤ or DL a Comic from the Comics tab they go here.
<h3>Recommend a Game...</h3>
Not exactly sure how this works, but I believe it's a section for requesting games to put into QooApp.
<h3>Check for Update...</h3>
Self explanatory.
<h3>Summon Servants...</h3>
This is an aesthetic feature to the app. You can DL QooApp's 2 mascots Gilbert and Elly and they will talk while you roam the app. You can also hide the icon but then you can't see the speech bubble.
<h3>Otome Portal...</h3>
Switches the app to show Otome games only. Doesn't do a really good job aside from the Featured section, but it does give the app a pink look. You can still browse regular games in the search bar.
<h3>Contact CS...</h3>
Customer Service through e-mail.
<h3>Settings...</h3>
Profile - You can customize your profile and it shows your Notes (comments you posted on games) and Cards (images/screencaps for games) as well as your favorite games. If you used a Google (and FB?) account, it will sync all of the games you played with Google Play and put it under the "My Favorite Games" section of your Profile.</p>

<p><h1>Now the top-right of the main screen...</h1>
<h3>Magnifying Glass...</h3>
Search Bar that searches based on Game, Developer, or keyword.
<h3>Gamepad icon...</h3>
Your games. Has a list of what QooApp games you have installed and ALL of the games you ever installed. Personally I do cleanup in the All games section but you can also leave it alone. The "Following" area is a list of games you personally ❤'ed
<h3>Smiling Egg Icon...</h3>
The social area. I have yet to join an active group in here, but your joined QooApp communities, community conversations, and friends you added (which is simple, just tap on someone and hit add friend.) Go in this area.
</p>

<p>Main 4 areas...
<h3>Featured...</h3>
Pretty straightforward...similar to a Youtube homepage, a little bit of everything and is always different over time. Show's peoples random reviews and what's out on pre-reg (not eng games, sadly)
<h3>Games...</h3>
Self-Explanatory...had random sub-categories. The Western and Others sub-categories is where most of the already launched NA/EU games are located as well as some games that were already shut down from Google Play.
<h3>News...</h3>
Mobile gaming news all over the world is in here as well as reviews. Comment on a News/review article at the bottom. The smiling egg is a like button and the speech bubble icon is viewing other comments.
<h3>Comics...</h3>
These comics I think are ripped from certain games and then uploaded to QooApp. That or maybe it was already availble on their social media platform and then they downloaded it. Not bad if you want to see Waifu Collector comics like Honkai Impact 3rd. Just like the News articles, you can comment at the bottom, and you have "like", "update plz", and "save to" buttons near the intro of the comic.
<h3>UI of a game icon...</h3>
Pretty standard interface of a game icon. Details section is a bit cleaner than Google Play's version. Timeline section is where you get to post a card or a note about the game. Some low populated games so have an active timeline whereas games like PAD or FGO would have people posting on there all the time. The smiling egg at the top-right shows all of the groups tied to that game. You can ❤ or download the game at the bottom.
By the time you get all of this you should be able to get around QooApp easily. Do note that if you have to update a game that's exclusive to QooApp or the QooApp itself. It won't notify you unless you get inside the app. (Correct me if there's a way.)</p>

<p>5. To access Google/Facebook: When logging in QooApp via Google and Facebook, QooApp reads the users&#8217; accounts without getting access to the passwords, and the whole log in process is done in Google and Facebook plug-in;</p>
<p>6. To display QooApp contents via another app: When visiting contents from QooApp in another app, users are able to open them in QooApp;</p>
