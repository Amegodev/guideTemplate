    <p>While they aren’t exactly called landmarks in the game itself, these are areas that are more distinguishable than
        simple cabins. Every map has at least one key location and typically contains some items like a shotgun, radio,
        and flaregun. While it can be tempting to go to these areas right away, we recommend waiting until the match is
        at least several minutes in. Big locations that are marked in yellow on your map usually have very little
        defense or none at all, meaning it can be super easy for Jason to secure a kill.</p>
    <p>If you spawn near one of the big houses get out of there as quickly as possible and head for a more secluded
        area. These big buildings always have a car outside, meaning that Jason will almost always pay a visit here to
        set some traps. Since you don’t want to be caught in a building with very little defenses, coming back when he’s
        busy with others is the safest bet.</p>

    <p>With the exception of the Savini Jason, there are 6 different masked killers that users will get to choose from
        before a round starts. Despite each one adhering to basic concepts, each one specializes in certain areas such
        as setting traps, moving faster in the water, or having shorter cooldowns for abilities. Understanding which
        Jason can do what is vital as it will allow you to tailor your playstyle to exploiting these weaknesses. For
        example, the Part 9 Jason has very little traps, meaning he has a small chance of being able to trap someone in
        a multi-window house. Use this to your advantage and keep ducking in and out of buildings he has no hope of
        completely sealing off.</p>
    <p>The same idea translates to how you plan to escape, as a Jason who’s faster in water will almost always catch the
        boat. If one of the Jason’s that’s quicker in water manages to get picked, try to make this your last option and
        focus on surviving by other means such as the cops or a car.</p>

    <p>Speaking of, be very careful if you decide to take the boat out and try to escape via the waterways. If Jason
        manages to knock you out into the water there’s an incredibly high chance that he is going to end up killing
        you. Since there is no escape and his underwater move is literally an instant kill move, it’s pretty much game
        over if he flips you. Because of this, make sure to use the boat either when Jason is distracted or if he’s one
        of the slower water variants like Part 2 Jason.</p>
    <p>If you do find Jason chasing you, try to avoid a straight line and duck around the rocks lining the water. Jason
        can be a bit tricky to control in the water, so you can trip him up by crashing the masked menace into the
        various debris. Going in a straight line makes you very easy to catch so unless you are not being followed there
        is no reason to do this.</p>

    <p>Perks are bonuses that are randomly generated when players spend 500 credits and they can offer a variety of
        different abilities like starting with a medical spray, increasing the range of your voice, or taking less
        damage when jumping through windows. Each of these perks can drastically increase your chances of survival, but
        you will want to tailor them to your counselor of choice’s statistics. For example, A.J. has very high stealth
        so you will want to pick perks like Heavy Sleeper and Sneaky to build upon this advantage. You only have three
        slots so we typically advise running two passive bonuses and one item Perk since this gives you a nice
        well-rounded suite of extras.</p>
    <p>Item Perks are simply ones that start the player out with an object like medical spray or a baseball bat, which
        are always nice to have since searching cabins can be a hit or miss affair. Try to not run Perks that are
        counter to what you want to be doing with that counselor in question, as the bonuses (unless they are the Epic
        rarity) are rarely that impactful unless it builds upon already strong stats. Giving someone like Tiffany repair
        Perks is just a waste since it won’t be that big of a chance and it’s way better to just focus on her stamina,
        speed, and stealth.</p>

            </p>
    <p>Every weapon in&nbsp;<em>Friday The 13th: The Game</em> has three hidden stats that determine its usefulness in
        battle if you do come across Jason. While any weapon is good against Jason, understanding what each one can do
        and what is best for the job is incredibly important. There is a big difference between hitting the masked
        killer with a stick and a large axe. These three stats are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stun – How effective the weapon is at temporarily stunning Jason</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Damage – How much damage is does against Jason</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Durability – How long the weapon lasts before it breaks</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The best overall weapon that players should use outside of a flare gun or shotgun is the baseball bat as it has
        the highest chance of stunning Jason when hit. Unless you’re actually trying to kill him, you will want to focus
        on stun over damage in most cases. While the machete might seem more like a logical pick since it’s the highest
        damage, the bat, branch, or wrench are far better options if you’re trying to survive.</p>
    <p>Try using the bat with counselors like Adam, Brandon, Kenny, and Vanessa and more ranged weapons for everyone
        else. Firing a flare gun at Jason can be a great way to escape, but if you’re using a counselor that has a
        better chance of stunning Jason multiple times then it behooves you to leave the one shot weapons alone.</p>

    <p>It can be easy to run out of stamina when you are being chased by Jason so you will need to master when to build
        your stamina and when to use it. This can be easier said than done if he is right on your heels, but typically a
        good rule of thumb to follow is never sprinting anywhere unless you have to. Typically when moving from house to
        house the base jog is enough, while crouch walking longer distances will help you conserve your energy if Jason
        shows up.</p>
    <p>One way to help you from running low is to stun Jason, gain a few feet, wait for your meter to build, and as soon
        as he can move run away. This allows you to not stumble and be easily caught&nbsp;even if you do stun him during
        a fight since most Jasons can recover quickly and cover a lot of ground. Another good way is if you get chased
        into a building don’t run around like an idiot, just stand there and wait until your stamina bar is full before
        trying to escape.</p>

    <p>Finally, there are a lot of ways to escape Jason’s grasps, but calling the cops is absolutely the best and most
        consistent way to survive are the cops. A car or boat can be easily stopped by Jason if the player driving
        doesn’t know how to juke or get around him quickly. While you do have to wait five minutes for the cops to
        arrive, a typical Jason player will just try to hang out by one of the road exits checking for anyone waiting to
        quickly escape.</p>
    <p>If the cops are called hangout by a road, but still stay a fair distance away so you aren’t spotted by his Sense
        ability. Once they actually arrive, make sure to have fireworks, a pocket knife, or some kind of weapon to
        defend yourself if you get cornered. Given how utterly reliant most Jasons are on their Shift ability, you can
        easily bait this move and then run once they pop out of it.</p>
    <p>The cops are also a great way to escape via a car or boat since Jason will undoubtedly be guarding the exit by
        the police. You can use this to your advantage and escape via the other entrances or just simply take the time
        to gather supplies and wait out the rest of the timer. Always try to call the cops, even if you are about to
        repair the car or boat because it works as a wonderful way to put pressure and stress on the Jason player.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Sit behind the driver in the four door so if he is grabbed you have less room to cover before restarting the
            car.</li>
        <li>Turn your microphone off unless you have to talk.</li>
        <li>Use camps to hide out in since Jasons rarely check these out.</li>
        <li>Get the Medic Perk so you can use a Medical Spray more than once.</li>
        <li>You can use pocket knives to break Jason’s beartraps.</li>
        <li>Only turn radios on when you are leaving the area.</li>
        <li>Cars can go off road, so don’t be afraid to drive in the dirt to avoid Jason.</li>
        <li>You can still call the cops if the power is off.</li>
        <li>Don’t forget to use your combat stance.</li>
